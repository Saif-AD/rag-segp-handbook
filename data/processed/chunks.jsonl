Therefore, this module focusses on team-based software engineering, project management, and collaboration with others, and it is assessed almost exclusively via group work. Compared to individual assessment, group work comes with considerable additional uncertainty or risk, because the achievements of your team are dependent on the abilities, attitudes, behaviours, and interactions of others, not just your own. The module is designed around managing that risk, promoting (rewarding) constructive and sustained engagement with team mates, effective collaboration, and sound project and team management. Learning and work practices that may have worked well for you in other modules, may not work for this module. \n\nThis handbook describes in considerable detail what is expected of you in this module. It describes the organisation of the module, what you need to learn to be successful in this module, the tools we use or can use, and how the assessments are organised and marked."}

This section explains in broad terms what the purpose of this module is. Virtually all Computer Science work involves other people. Software systems are typically developed by teams, often multi- disciplinary ones, for clients and end- users, with the support of people who provide financial support, support in- kind, or access to resources, and with consideration of people affected by the change the system will bring. Indeed, often the main challenges in software engineering stem from humans, not technology DeMarco+ Lister: 2013.

You are not being assessed on what you can produce individually, but on what you can contribute in collaboration with fellow students![ 10mm]{ To participate meaningfully with your group project, you must engage fully with your team. As a minimum, you must attend all meetings, listen to others, share your views, and present your work.} Group project work introduces a number of difficulties that you would not experience in an individual project.

Other contributions will be welcome and needed as well, but contributing weekly code is essential.} In this module, you will produce software systems as a team. Producing code is an important component activity in that process that everyone must fully engage with. However, software engineering goes beyond mere coding. Other important activities include agreeing business objectives for a client or prospective client, defining requirements and specifications for a software solution that would enable the objectives to be achieved, producing and continuously refining a design for the system, verification and validation including writing software tests and reviewing code quality, and deploying the system. The productivity of a software developer is enhanced substantially by means of tools.[ 0mm]{ As a Computer Scientist, you ought to be able to administer your own workstation without excessive reliance on IT support, so it is important that you develop the skills to do so.} These tools include( but are not limited to) a UNIX CLI to complete a range of system administration tasks, text/ code editors, interpreters/ compilers( typically called from a CLI), version control( e. g. git and GitHub), and build automation tools.

The SEG module consists of three parts:- Teaching& training. The taught component aims to ensure that you learn the fundamental knowledge and skills to enable you to participate in the group project. You will learn some important fundamentals of project management, software engineering, and software development tools and practices. You will also be trained in a new programming language and framework that you will use in the small group project( and optionally in the major group project). This component consists of live lectures, video lectures, small group tutorials, and self- guided coding exercises. It takes place in the first eight weeks of the academic year, though most of it will be complete before the Semester 1 reading week.- Small group project. In the second half of Semester 1, you will participate in a six- week group project. Think of this project as`` practice'' group project. It is relatively low risk as it contributes only a small portion your overall mark. If anything goes very wrong, you will not lose all that much. However, you are likely to experience a number of potentially significant challenges of group project work. The experience you develop in this project will be valuable as you tackle the final stage of the module. All teams will be working on the same assignment( to deliver a deployed web application) and use the same technologies.

There is only one assignment that all teams must complete (though there is considerable flexibility in scope, depending on effective team size and ability). The major group project covers all of Semester 2. Students can form their own teams of around 8 people and teams can choose the technology stack. A range of project assignments will be proposed to cater for a wide range of interests.\n\nBoth group projects have the same overall assessment structure. Each individual overall group project mark consists of two components: an individual group project mark accounts for 95% of the mark and a peer assessment mark for 5%.

At the end of each group project, you must participate in a peer assessment exercise. In each peer assessment exercise, you asked to fill out a peer assessment form for each of people you worked with in the team. This form consists of a number of short, usually multiple- choice questions, and feedback field that allows you to write open- ended feedback for your team mate. Some time after the deadline for submitting the peer assessments, you will receive feedback from the peer assessments your team mates returned about you. The author of each peer assessment will not be revealed to you. You will have an opportunity to respond to the peer assessments you received, but you are not required to respond. If a peer assessment contains factual errors or if you wish to provide context for a peer assessment, then it is a good idea to respond so that the concerns you have about a peer assessment are recorded in the system. The peer assessments are used in two ways. Firstly, the peer assessments you write are assessed and contribute to your overall mark. Your overall mark for each assignment( i. e. the small group project mark and the major group project mark) is the weighted average of your individual group project mark and your peer assessment mark. The peer assessments you write contribute 5% to the assignment mark.

As this module assesses your ability to work in teams, the marking schemes are designed to promote team work rather than individual work. To do well in the module, focus your efforts on improving the team' s output. The group projects are assessed on work delivered by teams. This work is assessed to produce the team' s group project mark. Individual group project marks are based on the team' s group project mark, but it is not necessarily identical to it. An individual group project mark is computed using one of two formula, depending on whether the individual is counted as a participant who met all the expectations of the group project in full. If an team member did not meet the individual expectations for the group project, the individual mark will be a reduced proportion of the team mark: project mark= team mark( 1- major correction) where the major correction is in the range 10% to 100%, depending on the extent expectations were not met. An individual mark scheme describes the circumstances in which a major correction is applied and how large it is. If an individual is counted as a full member of the team, their mark will be very close to the team mark( i. e. within 5 percentage points of it: project mark= team mark minor adjustment where minor adjustment ranges from- 5 to+ 5. The minor adjustments are effectively a small redistribution of marks( within a narrow range), where marks of some team members are moved to other team members.

The minor adjustment range equals- 5 to+ 5 to ensure that( only in extreme cases) the difference between the lowest and highest marked fully contributing team member is no more than a grade boundary.{- 10mm Reality check: It is impossible for a marker to conduct an objective comparative assessment of the contributions of individual members. To achieve that, a marker would have to be intimately familiar with the inner workings of each team. We simply do not and should not have that kind of access to a reasonably independent team. Moreover, there often is no objective truth. In a team of five people, there will be up to five different opinions on the merits of every members work. Where teams work well, individual contributions are not easily separated from one another. As markers cannot prefer one student' s views over those of another, individual marking will be based on the evidence available to us-- participation statistics, code statistics, and peer assessments. Subsequent pleas cannot change individual marking. However, reports of errors in the evidence or falsification of evidence will be considered.} Both group projects come with minor mark redistribution schemes to decide minor adjustments. Because nobody involved in the group projects is both impartial and omniscient( the team members are not impartial, and the lecturers not omniscient), these redistribution schemes are inevitably crude. In essence, they seek to reward people with an adjustment of+ 3, 4, or 5 where the peer assessments and other contributions statistics are significantly greater than those of others, or penalise with an adjustment of- 3, 4, or 5 where those statistics are significantly smaller"}

How will that affect us? A common concern among students is the effect of team size on team output. Initial team sizes vary as your class size is unlikely to be completely divisible by our desired team size. Moreover, each year, a number of students fail to engage with their group project team, disengage from the group project, or need to interrupt their studies. Some small group project teams will have 5 people. Some teams may end up with just three people, or even two in extreme cases. Many assume that smaller teams have a disadvantage compared to larger teams. After all, larger teams have more people to produce work during the same period of time. Therefore, one might expect their combined output will be larger. In practice, that is not universally true. In fact, Brook' s law suggests that`` adding[ people] to a late software project makes it later'' Brooks: 1975. Based on observations made during his professional experience, Brooks suggests that as teams grow, they have greater communication and coordination costs, and the increase in these costs can be greater than the benefit of the extra person. Nevertheless, the detailed team marking criteria for the small and major group projectYou can find the team marking criteria for each project in the chapter on that project. consider the number of people actively engaged with the group project. This will be referred to as the team' s effective size.

For example, if no member of a team of 4 people has a major correction, their effective team size equals 4. If, in a team of 5, two member receive a major correction of- 70%, the effective size of that team is deemed to be 3. 5($ 5- 0. 7- 0. 7= 3. 6$, rounded down to the nearest 0. 5. The marking schemes mention effective team size exclusively in relation to functionality. Teams with fewer people should build applications that are smaller in scope. All other criteria are assessed irrespective of team size. As a general rule, try to complete tasks as soon as possible, and delay decisions as late as possible. It is not possible to determine a team' s effective size until the project is over. Some teams wonder how they can possible decide the scope of the project at the start when they do not know what the engagement of team members will be. The answer to that question is that you don' t decide the scope at the start. By building software incrementally and iteratively, always ensuring that what you do adds value, the impact of the risk of unpredictable team size can be reduced considerably."}

The module lecturers cannot offer any form of mitigation( including deadline extensions), so if you send them a request for mitigation, they can only signpost the MCF processes.

We only offer a reassessment of the major group project once a year, in the Semester 2. There are good reasons for this. The major group project assesses how students work in teams. Therefore, it can only be assessed through a larger/ longer group project in a substantial team. It is challenging to organise this reliably.

You can use generative AI as an alternative to Python and Django documentation to find the functions, classes, and methods that enable you to reuse existing code. Generative AI tools are also useful as an alternative to searching/ browsing tutorials, forums( e. g. Stack Overflow), and examples to find out how to complete common tasks. In software development, this type of code is normally reused but generative AI makes it easier to find and use as it can generate more readily usable examples from natural language prompts.

This can make you considerably more productive as a software engineer. However, it also introduces new challenges as it allows you to build larger systems more quickly. Generative AI tools tend to do well on small, common, and highly specific coding tasks. However, if you set it tasks that are larger, less common, or framed in vaguer terms, these tools become increasingly less reliable. Generated code may fail to meet the requirements of the task, software quality standards, or the design assumptions of other parts of the code. You are responsible for any code that you share with the team. In particular, you must ensure that the code is fit for purpose, meets your team' s quality standards, and permits integration with the remainder of the system. As mentioned at the outset of this section, generative AI is a powerful tool. It is not a hack: you will need to keep your brain switched and use these tools responsibly. The College requires that all contributions by generative AI systems are acknowledged, including code. I appreciate this is cumbersome, but it is a College requirement that I am not allowed to overturn. For both group projects, you should acknowledge all sources in the README. md file, but not through comments in the code( as that undermines code cleanliness). For each use of generative AI, state the path to the file, the affected function, method, or class, the number of lines of code, and a qualitative assessment of the proportion of generated code of the function, method, or class(`` whole unit'',`` more than 50% of the unit'',`` about 50% of the unit'"}

As a rule of thumb, the College suggests that 1 credit in a course should correspond to 10 hours work. In other words, this module should require approximately 300 hours of work. This guideline ignores some very important factors, such as your prior earning, innate ability, productivity, and your ambitions. Nevertheless, this section will use that guideline to advise you how you should expect to allocate your time to this module. Please adjust the 300 hour headline figure to your individual requirements. Normally, you can distribute your work evenly between Semesters 1 and 2. In other words, you will need approximately 150 hours per Semester. If programming( e. g. as taught in 4CCS1PPA), data structures, and database systems were modules you struggled with in Year 1, or if you struggle with the computer literacy skills the module requires, then you should dedicate more time on this module in Semester 1. If you choose to join a very ambitious team for the major group project, you should dedicate more time to the module in Semester 2.[ 0mm]{ Aim to dedicate about 14 to 15 hours per week to this module during term time.

The general trend in software engineering is one of increasing availability of increasingly sophisticated tools. The most recent development is the emergence of generative AI tools (which you will be encouraged to employ, responsibly). \n\nIn this module, we make extensive use of a wide range of software engineering tools. All the tools we use are tools that regular, professional develops use: no ``training wheels'' IDE (such as BlueJ) will be provided to shield you from some of the complexity of software development. There are certain tools that you must use and others where you are allowed to select from a range of tools. Some tools are essential to enable collaborative software development in teams. It is also important that you ensure your individual development environment is compatible with that of your team mates. In this section, we will identify what tools/type of tools you need to use, and make some recommendations for specific tool categories where you get a choice.\n\nAs the module starts (from the very start of the academic year), you must ensure that you have regular access to a workstation that has the software you need installed. This can be a Faculty lab PC, a Faculty student VM (a virtual machine you access from a web browser), or your own laptop or desktop PC. It is critical that you do not procrastinate organising your workstation and access to the necessary tools: doing so would delay your learning and ability to engage with the group projects."}

It is best learned by using it routinely for file management, version control, and accessing dev ops tools. If this a new skill, make sure you always have some type of cheat sheet to hand. There is no need to memorise commands.} A UNIX shell provides a CLI to your operating system. It allows you to access system administration commands that come with the operating system, and software tools using a text- interface. At first, this may seem like an old- fashioned way of interacting with your computer. However, it is by far the most flexible and efficient way to work with many system administration and software development tools. UNIX' CLI enables instructions with a wide range of arguments. Different commands can be combined with one another, for example by feeding the output of one command as the input of another. Moreover, when access certain systems, such as servers, remotely, a CLI may be the only interface available to you. Therefore, familiarity with the UNIX CLI is an essential skill for software engineers. Linux and macOS come with UNIX shells through the Terminal application. On Windows, you need to install the Windows Subsystem for Linux( WSL) to have access to a UNIX shell. Most of the time, a UNIX CLI is an incredibly convenient tools for a proficient power user, but not essential. However, there will be certain occasions where the team must use a UNIX CLI.

Is using an integrated development environment( IDE) allowed? A lightweight code editor focusses primarily on supporting code editing. This distinguishes it from an IDE, which combines all the software development tools a developer needs into a single application. Software engineers continuously develop tools that aim to improve productivity in software development through analysis, visualisation, and automation. An IDE encourages developers to use the set of tools supported through the IDE' s interface. In the face of prolific growth of available software development tools, that can sometimes be constraining. More importantly, software produced with certain IDE may be difficult to edit and review without access to the IDE, which may affect collaboration with teammates and assessment. A lightweight code editor does not come with such baggage and it pairs well with a UNIX shell. My advice to you is that you should use a lightweight code editor( in combination with a UNIX shell). You can use any code editor you like. You are not prohibited from using an IDE. However, if you choose to use an IDE, you are responsible for the consequences of that choice. In particular:- You must ensure that the IDE plays nice with the version control tools you are using. An IDE may generate a number of files that should not be version controlled. Failing to exclude such files from a team' s repository may cause your code contributions not to be recognised. Consider yourself forewarned that this is not something that can or should normally be corrected.- If multiple team members are using IDE, failing to exclude IDE related data from a shared repository can cause spurious merge conflicts.- The examiners will not be using any IDE.

Time spent towards setting up an IDE is especially productive. Therefore, you should only use an IDE if you know what you are doing. In general, it is only worth doing if you are confident that using the IDE ensures you are more productive. Table tab: software- requirements: 1 suggests some code editors and some IDE that can be used as code editors. Personally, I prefer Sublime.

Version control software is an essential tool to manage your code base. It is especially important when multiple people are working on the same codebase( ideally on different parts of it) simultaneously. In this module, we will be using Git for version control along with GitHub to maintain a shared code repository for the entire team. Git needs to be installed on your workstation. It may already be installed. On a UNIX machine( including macOS), you can check whether git is installed by opening a UNIX shell/ Terminal window and executing the command:$ which git If Git is installed, this will return the directory where the executable resides. GitHub is a web service to maintain a remote repository. Figure fig: github explains the relation between Git and GitHub, from the perspective of a software developer working in a team. Each workstation maintains a local repository that is managed via Git. In addition, a GitHub server stores a remote repository. Every time you`` commit'' code to their local repository, you should also`` push'' that commit to the remote repository on GitHub. Other team members can then see that you have done work, and review your work on GitHub.

Teams and team members must adhere to certain rules of engagement when using version tools.

Team Feedback is a system developed to manage SEG. It collates all information lecturers need to track teams and team members in one place. You will use it to form teams (or receive your team allocation in case of the small group project), record meetings (including attendance and minutes), track code contribution statistics, submit, receive and respond to peer assessments, record collaborative coding sessions, and receive your team and individual marks. This section explains the role of these various features in more detail."}

It is not necessary for the meeting to have been scheduled in order to record the meeting. To start recording a new meeting, click the``+ New meeting'' button. At the start, you must record attendance for every member of the team. You cannot proceed to create the meeting and edit the minutes until attendance has been taken. Once a meeting is created, a record of the meeting will be listed in a table, along with a deadline to complete editing. The meeting will only remain editable until the time shown there. This ensures that edits are timely corrections( not a rewrite of the team' s history). While this is possible, click the edit button to edit the meeting or the delete button to delete the meeting record if it was created by accident. Who? FAQ( Team meetings): Who must record the team' s meeting on Team Feedback? The purpose of the meeting is to have a written record of team member engagement, decisions taken, and actions assigned. Therefore, each meeting must be recorded by one and only one person. You must agree within the team who is responsible for recording the meeting. It is worth acknowledging that at the meeting itself, so that the meeting is recorded and there are no duplicate records of the same meeting. When?

A team meeting must be recorded when the meeting takes place. The best approach is for the minute taker to write the meeting minutes on a laptop during the meeting, and polish them after the meeting. Create a meeting record at the very start of the meeting. The first step is to record attendance. Start by recording everyone there as`` on time'' and everyone who is absent as`` absent''. You can correct for late arrivals later. Start writing notes under the meeting minutes/ summary as the discussion proceeds. After the meeting, take some time to polish the minutes so that they will be understandable in the future or by teaching staff reading your minutes. Some time after the minutes were created, team members will have access to the minutes. They should check the attendance record and minutes and send corrections in the days that follow the meeting( up to one week after the meeting took place). The minute taker should make corrections as necessary during this period. If nobody raises any issues and the edit window ends, the minutes will be considered correct and no more editing will be possible. Scope?

Please note that the team should have at least one team coordination/ planning meeting or accountability session per week. Meeting less frequently than will limit the team' s ability to respond to risks and changing circumstances. Meeting more frequently that once a week may be difficult to sustain over longer periods of time( though you are welcome to do so). Mode of attendance FAQ( Team meetings): Should a team meeting be in person, online, or hybrid? Teams should decide internally what`` attendance'' means. I recommend that the weekly meeting a team record on Team Feedback is in- person. This approach has several advantages. An in- person meeting requires a more significant commitment to the project than an online meeting. To attend such a meeting on- time and in- full requires some effort. In- person attendance encourages greater engagement with the meeting. If your meeting is online, someone can`` attend'' by phoning into the meeting while on a bus or train, but their focus is likely to be elsewhere. At an in- person meeting, it is also easier to share information. Hybrid meetings should be avoided. They split the group between the online presence and the in- person presence and makes communication that much harder. Once the mode of attendance has been agreed, stick to the rules( until your team management approaches are reviewed). Once you start bending the rules, it will become increasingly difficult to enforce them. Consider, for example, a team that normally meets in- person. One person calls in asking to participate in the meeting online. If you allow this, some of the people"}

Consider, for example, a team that normally meets in- person. One person calls in asking to participate in the meeting online. If you allow this, some of the people present will regret the effort they made to travel to the meeting, and feel entitled to ask for the same accommodation at a future meeting. Attendance records FAQ( Team meetings): How important are Team Feedback meeting attendance records? It is critically important that team members attend all meetings. Communication and coordination become much harder if some people do not attend meetings, but expect to be informed of meeting outcomes or share their views. To prevent such complications, teams are advised not accommodate absences. To ensure that team members attend meetings, each team must keep accurate records of meeting attendance via Team Feedback. Accurate attendance record keeping incentivises team members to attend meetings in full and helps the marking team identify students who do not engage adequately with their team. Do not be tempted to mark someone as attending if they abstain from the meeting. If you do this for one person, it would be unfair to refuse to do this for someone else. Without accurate attendance records, it will be difficult to demonstrate later on that a team member did not engage adequately with the team. For these reasons, teams that fail to keep accurate attendance records from the start of the project end up regretting this. Agenda FAQ( Team meetings): Do meetings require an agenda? Effective meetings tend to have an agenda. An agenda gives attendees forewarning of what will be discussed and what they need to prepare. The agenda should normally include the discussion topics, an indication of the expected outcome of each topic, the person or people responsible for leading the discussion, and a time budget."}

Over time, people tend to forget or misremember what was agreed at team meetings and why. Clear and complete meeting minutes are part of the team' s`` memory'', allowing everyone to review the teams' decisions. The meeting minutes should include all:- Agreed decisions and their rationale. Make sure that the decisions that have been agreed are written up sufficiently clearly to allow future you to make sense of the minutes. Recording the rationale for a decisions allows team members to understand why the team made a particular decision at the time. If a rationale turned out to be invalid( or no longer valid), that may constitute a grounds for reviewing the decisions.- Actions, including the person responsible for completing them and the deadline for completion. The team should keep track of its action log, so as to ensure that actions are completed. To record good meeting minutes, someone should be assigned responsibility for completing them. Ideally, the meeting minutes write up starts during the meeting and is completed as possible thereafter. Allow team members are reasonable opportunity to submit corrections."}

Every team should register all shared repositories worked on by the team on Team Feedback. Team Feedback will collect commit data from registered repositories on a daily basis until the end of the project. If your git repository is set up correctly, GitHub will be able to attribute commits to GitHub accounts. Team feedback uses this to produce engagement statistics for every team member. How you organise your work in repositories is up to your team. Avoid using more repositories than necessary. In the small group project, one repository should suffice. In the major group project, you probably want to separate the report from the source code. If the software system you are building consists of distinct components that run on different machines, you may or may not store them in separate repositories. Code contribution data FAQ( Code contribution): How is the code contribution data on Team Feedback used? The code contribution data is used to assess whether:- A team member makes substantial code contributions sufficiently regularly. To assess this, we examine the number of calendar weeks in which a team member contributed a sufficient number of lines of code.- Enough of a team member' s code is of a usable standard. To assess this, we examine how much of a team member' s code is merged with the main branch. In other words, code contribution data is collected to assess to what extent each team member makes a reasonable effort to engage meaningfully with the team' s work throughout the development period. The small group project and major group project chapters in this handbook provide more detailed guidelines as to how this is assessed.

Team Feedback statistics include total lines of code, lines of code in the main branch, total numbers of commits, and commits in the main branch, relative to other members of the team. This data is provided for information only, to give you an idea as to what other members of the team do. However, it is impossible for the marks to make reliable judgements based on such data. Line count data is a notoriously unreliable type of statistics to measure code contributions. Line count data correlates very poorly to effort or code quality. Therefore, we cannot use such statistics, certainly not to determine who did more work or who did less work. Missing data FAQ( Code contribution): Team Feedback is missing some of my code contribution data. Is that a problem? Team Feedback should have a record of all your coding activity. If it does not, that is a problem that you must take steps to correct as soon as possible. Before contacting anyone, it is advisable to identify what the problem is. The most probable causes( from most likely to least likely) are as follows:- You did not configure git correctly on the( or one of the) workstation( s) you are using.- The missing coding activity occurred less than 24 hours ago and has not been recorded yet.- You collaborated on this commit with someone else who has not registered the collaborative coding session correctly.- A team member has altered the commit history of the project and erased some of your coding activity.- The Team Feedback server has been down and its records are out of date.

Falsified code activity FAQ( Code contribution): I suspect a member of my team has faked code contribution data. What can be done about this? There are ways in which people can create the impression of having made contributions to the code without doing any meaningful work. One approach is to move code around unnecessarily and committing this change. Another is to add unnecessary code, commit the change, remove the unnecessary code again, and commit that change. Doing this type of thing with a view to create the impression of coding activity without the intent of contributing anything constitutes falsification of data. It is a form of misconduct.

Some teams may wish to tackle certain tasks to two or more people, to be completed through pair or mob programming. If such an approach is adopted, two or more people code using a single machine. One person acts as the driver and types in the code. The other person or people act as navigator( s), guiding the driver. If you adopt this particular approach, you must ensure that the work is attributed to the driver and the navigator( s). To ensure this, you must adopt the following protocol:- During a pair/ mob programming session, all commits should be made using a single machine. The author this machine' s git installation is configured for is the committer. In this way, all work produced collaboratively is attributed to a single author: the committer.- As soon as possible after the session, the committer must register a collaborative coding session on Team Feedback. When creating the session, ensure that the start time precedes the start time of the session and the end time succeeds the end time of the session.

These topics require you to develop new practical knowledge and skills. The amount of new theoretical or conceptual content, beyond what you already learned in Year 1, is limited. In my view, such content is best learned outside of lecture theatre. One effective approach is to learn content in small bursts, followed immediately by exercises. Another is to follow along with a demonstration on your own computer, mimicking each step that is demonstrated. In this module, you will be using both these approaches to learn Python, Django, and a range of devops tools. There will be some forms of support to help you out when you get stuck, but you should be going through this material as independently as you can. In your independent study, consider the following:- In the first five weeks of Semester 1, before the group project start, you should dedicate a substantial majority of your weekly study time for this module( approximately 15hrs/ week) to independent study. Do not postpone this as it will be hard to catch up later.- Complete all exercises. When shown demonstrations, replicate each demonstration on your workstation.

Consequently, each comes with its own set of expectations. Nevertheless, there is a core set of expectations for both group projects and it is crucial that you meet them. The expectations listed below are fundamental though, so you should adhere to them and expect you team mates to adhere to them.- In the group projects, you will be working closely with fellow students. You are expected to behave respectfully to one another during lectures, outside of lectures, in meetings, when communicating online, through email, or through collaborative development tools. The College does not tolerate inappropriate or demeaning comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, religion, age, or any other personal characteristic. If you witness or experience any behaviour you are concerned about, please speak to someone about it.- Group work requires communication and coordination. As a team, you must agree project objectives, plan and schedule work towards those objectives, monitor progress, and agree remedial actions when plans/ schedules fail or other problems arise.

Your team mates are not your personal assistant: do not expect your team mates to keep track of team decisions or your responsibilities for you. You need to do that yourself.- Every member of the team must make a meaningful contribution to the team' s code base every week of the software build period. That implies nobody is excused from coding! A week is defined as period from Monday to Sunday( inclusive). The project' s software build period corresponds to the weeks in which at least some team members are writing code. In the small group project, the software build period should encompass the full six weeks of the project. In the major group project, it is likely to be a little less than the full ten week period of the project because of the amount of non- coding work involved."}

As this is a module is about working with others, you will have to tell others how they are doing or how they did. You will participate in two peer assessment exercises( via Team Feedback), one after each group project. In a peer assessment exercise, you are required to fill out a form for each of your team member: including a number of multiple choice questions and a feedback field. The feedback text is a critical component of any peer assessment. Without any feedback text, a peer assessment will not be awarded any marks. At the very least, explain why you scored your team mate in the way that you did in the multiple- choice section. Without any feedback, the peer review is merely a collection of vague claims. You can also use the feedback field to elaborate on your experiences with a team member, provide some detail and context for your review, illustrate claims with some examples or anecdotes, and reflect what you or your team might have learned in group project exercise. If there is good communication within your team, the feedback in peer assessments should not come as a surprise. Team members should talk to each other about how the project is going. Concerns should be shared within the team: ideally at team meetings if it concerns everyone, or at a one- to- one meeting if a difficult conversation with a single person is required. When you write feedback, be considerate and inclusive. Another fellow human being will hear what you are saying or read what you have written.

Disparaging criticism without nuance or consideration of the reviewee can be hurtful-- ultimately, it is counter productive. That does not mean your feedback should be relentlessly positive or minimise valid criticism. On the contrary, it is important to voice genuine concerns in a timely manner, and persistently follow it up. Peer assessments should contain an accurate and complete critique: do not gloss over the problem. There are some techniques you can employ to formulate negative feedback considerately and constructively. Examples include, but are not limited to the following.- Balance negatives with specific, meaningful praise. Criticism in feedback tends to be more acceptable to the recipient if the feedback also incorporates due recognition to positive experience. Be specific( not vague) when praising your peer in feedback to show you paid attention and appreciated what went well. Make sure that the praise concerns meaningful issues. Faint praise can come across as condescending, or even as criticism in disguise. Praise is only a usable tool if you have something of value to complement.- You can take the previous method one step further with the sandwich method. In the sandwich method, you start by saying something positive about the other person, then introduce the negative feedback, and conclude with more positive feedback. This can work especially when you need to give negative feedback to someone in person. People do tend to recognise the sandwich method, so it is especially important that any positive feedback you want to use here is genuine.- In your feedback, focus on actions and behaviours.

We can change our actions and behaviours. It is harder to change our personality or character. If feedback concerns the person, rather than their actions and behaviours, then it becomes something that is difficult to correct or address.- Use sentences start with`` I'', such as`` I think[...]'' or`` I feel[...]''. By starting a sentence with`` I'', you are forcing yourself to focus on your perceptions and views of the other person' s actions and behaviours. It is another way to avoid making the negative feedback about the person being criticises.- Always ensure your negative feed back is specific. Vague feedback tends to be very demoralising. On the one hand, it suggests concerns are broader than they really are. On the other hand, vague feedback is hard to act on.- Provide actionable feedback. This gives your peer agency and control over a problem, as well as an opportunity to address it. Negative feedback is not the only tool in your arsenal to encourage your team mates to do the right thing. Negative feedback' s counterpart-- positive reinforcement-- can be more effective if you make a point of praising people consistently and regularly for what they do well."}

In software development, building a system or application typically qualifies as a project: it represents a one-off effort that requires focused coordination, planning, and execution.\n\nBecause projects involve a substantial commitment of resources, especially the time and expertise of skilled people, they must be managed carefully to ensure that this investment results in something valuable. Unlike routine operations, project work is often exploratory and uncertain, which means it carries more risk. Effective project management anticipates these uncertainties and prepares the team to respond when things do not go as planned.\n\nAt the heart of any project is a team. In software development, much of the work is creative, and relies heavily on collaboration among individuals with diverse skills and perspectives. For this reason, good project management is not just about tasks, timelines, or tools. It is about enabling people to work well together. This chapter offers practical guidance on how to manage student software projects effectively, with particular attention to teamwork, communication, and navigating the human factors that so often determine a project's success."}

Managing software development projects is inherently challenging due to the complex interplay of technical and human factors. A substantial software project requires a significant amount of work distributed across multiple people. This collaborative effort must be tightly coordinated to ensure that everyone is aligned with the same goals, that features integrate smoothly, and that the overall product, particularly the user interface, presents a consistent and coherent experience. One of the key difficulties is that the quality of the software is determined by its weakest component. Even if most parts are well- engineered, a single poorly implemented module or lack of sufficient testing can undermine the entire product. As such, project managers must ensure that quality is maintained across all dimensions: code, design, documentation, test coverage, and security, to name a few. In addition to technical challenges, software teams are composed of individuals who may hold differing opinions on important issues, such as the project' s direction, team workflows, or even the next steps to take. Disagreements over priorities, tools, or practices can lead to friction or misalignment if not managed carefully. Ultimately, project management is about enabling people to work together effectively to achieve a shared outcome. While there are many structured techniques for planning, tracking progress, managing risk, and facilitating communication, and these are relatively straightforward to learn and apply, the real difficulty lies in the human side of the equation. Getting everyone to buy into a common vision, agree on how to collaborate, stay motivated, and function as a cohesive team requires soft skills that are much harder to teach. It demands empathy, judgement, adaptability, and trust. These qualities develop through experience. And even with an experienced manager, the trust needed to bind a team together can take time to"}

In this handbook, we use the term to mean the ability to guide a group toward positive outcomes through influence rather than coercion. Leadership is therefore rooted in informal authority: the respect and trust your colleagues freely grant you. Leadership is not a power (e.g. as bestowed through a job title) to coerce people into doing what you want them to do.\n\nCrucially, leadership should never be seen as the exclusive domain of one designated ``manager''. Every team member who has insight, expertise, or a fresh perspective must be ready to step forward and influence the group when the moment calls for it.\n\nDisagreements are inevitable in creative work: teammates come with different objectives, values, priorities, working styles, and talents. Without the safety net of formal authority, these differences can stall progress or, if handled well, spark better decisions. Navigating them takes judgement: the wisdom to know when to compromise, when to hold your ground, and how to prevent a clash of ideas from sliding into interpersonal conflict. In other words, leadership is the social lubricant that keeps collaboration moving when the project grows messy and uncertain."}

Figure fig: four- foundational- behaviours illustrates the cycle. uniform color list= white! 90! gray for 4 items, uniform arrow color= true,[ circular diagram: clockwise]{ Demonstrate respect, Listen first, Clarify expectations, Practice accountability} Four foundational behaviours to build informal authority- Demonstrate respect. If people feel you respect them, they are more likely to engage in conversations with( even the more difficult ones). Treat teammates as capable professionals whose time and opinions matter. Respect is conveyed through courtesy, genuine curiosity about their viewpoints, and consideration for their constraints. Respect does not require you to agree with everything people are telling you. It also means confronting reality: raising difficult issues promptly and candidly. Ignoring emerging problems, or saving criticism for anonymous peer reviews, is itself disrespectful.- Listen first. Take the time to hear out people before commenting, drawing conclusion, or preempting what they will say. This is especially important when having challenging conversation. Unless you take the to listen to others before you share your opinion, you cannot really have considered their views or any important information they might have to share. Failing to listen can cause tension and strain your relationship with your team mates.- Clarify expectations. Misunderstandings multiply as a project evolves.

Practicing accountability involves recognising concerns certain individuals are responsible for, identifying the nature of the issue, and pursuing remedial action until the concern is removed. Without accountability, problems tend to fester until the team eventually lose control over these problems. Practicing accountability requires three things.( i) Be transparent: when you see a problem, speak up.( ii) Attain buy- in from your team mates to address the problem. Demonstrating respect, listening first, and clarifying expectations all help you obtain buy- in.( iii) Follow through( persistently) until the issue is resolved.

Their mission is to steer the team toward the project objectives while honouring constraints of scope, schedule, budget, and quality. To do so they must:\n\n- Maintain a wide-angle view. Individual specialists focus deeply on their own tasks; the project manager watches the big picture, anticipates cross-stream dependencies, and highlights looming risks before they bite.\n\n- Clear obstacles. Rather than dictating technical solutions, the manager removes blockers, securing resources, negotiating with external stakeholders, or adjusting priorities, so experts can do their best work.\n\n- Cultivate trust in both directions. The team must trust the manager's guidance, and the manager must trust the team's expertise. That trust is earned through the same four behaviours outlined above, amplified by transparency in decision-making and a willingness to admit mistakes.\n\n- Make success invisible. When project management is effective, progress feels smooth and crises are rare, so the contribution can go unnoticed. Poor management, by contrast, is painfully obvious. Accepting that asymmetry is part of the job.\n\nGood software development project managers, therefore, rely heavily on people skills, blended with broad technical systems thinking."}

This includes answering a number of foundational questions:\n\n- What are the project objectives? \n\n- Who are the key stakeholders in this project and how will the project outcome affect them?\n\n- What are the priorities if trade-offs are required?\n\n- Who is part of the project team?\n\n- What constraints (e.g., time, resources, budget, quality) must the team operate under?\n\n- What is out of scope for this project?\n\n- What does success look like? How will it be measured?\n\nProjects often fail because these questions are inadequately addressed. Initial project proposals are frequently overambitious relative to available resources, and failing to identify key stakeholders early can lead to wasted effort and misaligned deliverables. Misunderstanding how success will be evaluated, especially by stakeholders with decision-making power, can lead to disappointment at project completion.\n\nIn your group projects, these concerns are just as relevant. You may receive briefs that are intentionally broad or ambitious, and it is your team's responsibility to refine them into realistic, achievable objectives. Functionality will be assessed not only on what your software does, but also on the value it provides to its intended users. If your project involves a real client, these users are real people. Moreover, your assessment will follow detailed marking criteria. Understanding how your project will be graded is essential from day one."}

Planning involves identifying the activities required to achieve the project' s objectives, and organising people and resources to carry them out. This means creating a project schedule and determining who does what, when, and how. Planning is difficult because it requires you to predict what is achievable given the available time, effort, and information. However, skipping planning leads to inefficiencies. Teams risk duplicating effort, missing critical tasks, or working on features that ultimately are not needed. One critical part of planning is risk management. Projects rarely go exactly as planned, and anticipating what might go wrong helps teams avoid or minimise negative outcomes. Risk management involves:- Identifying risks: Reflect carefully on what could go wrong in the project? If your team fails to consider a potential risk, you cannot manage it.- Analysing risks: For each identified risk, consider its probability and its potential impact.- Risk planning: High- probability or high- impact risks should be addressed. Finally, risks with high probability or high impact need to be managed. For example, teams could take actions to avoid certain risks( to reduce the probability), or prepare a contingency plan( to reduce the impact). If a project contains high- probability, high- impact risks that cannot be managed, it may not be worth pursuing in its current form. Beyond technical tasks and timelines, you are working with people: people who have their own goals, pressures, and commitments outside your project. A good project plan accounts for these human factors. This includes:- A communication plan: Regular meetings( e. g., weekly at the same time and place), communication tools( e. g., Slack, WhatsApp), and agreements about availability"}

Documentation, expectations for code quality( e. g., testing, refactoring), and demo/ reporting practices should be agreed upon early.- Rules for version control: Consistent use of Git( or equivalent) avoids confusion, merge conflicts, and overwritten work As the project progresses, your plan will need to evolve. Unanticipated issues will arise, and you will need to adapt your schedule, risk strategy, and working agreements accordingly."}

What are the challenges in getting the plan executed? This phase is about doing the work. The plan is put in to practice, tasks are completed, features are built, and deliverables are produced. However, the execution phase often brings a new challenge: maintaining team engagement. Initial excitement tends to fade. Team members get busy with other modules or responsibilities. Sometimes even clients become less responsive. In group projects, this disengagement often takes teams by surprise, and it can stall progress. The most effective way to sustain engagement is to develop a practice of accountability, built around predictable routines and shared expectations. For example:- Hold regular, time- boxed team meetings( e. g., weekly stand- ups of 30-- 40 minutes).- Begin your meetings on time, stay on task, and keep it short.- Use a shared project board( e. g., Kanban) to track work and guide discussion.- As part of your meeting, have each team member reports on what they committed to, what they have completed, and any obstacles they face.- Task assignments should be made collaboratively, allowing people to choose work that aligns with their interests and strengths.- When problems arise, assign someone( typically the project manager) to clear the path forward. Avoid behaviours that disrupt accountability:- Irregular or ad hoc meetings make it hard to coordinate and deliver. Attendance may be poor. Deadlines remain unclear.- Waiting around for team members to arrive, perhaps engaging in text conversations with them complaining about London public transport, disrupts the focus of the meeting.

Team members should make every effort to arrive on campus well before the meeting so that the meeting can start on time in spite of minor disruptions.- Off- topic chatter lengthens meetings and undermines focus.- Excuses or blame distract from the immediate goal: making decisions and moving forward. The team needs to focus current progress and decisions about next steps. Accusatory conversations detract from that.- Top- down task assignment( especially from a self- appointed`` leader'') can breed resentment.- Ignoring obstacles you know to block a recently assigned task' s progress sets up the person responsible for failure. Every team member, and especially a project manager, should aim to anticipate problems and speak up when they can foresee them. Despite best intentions, teams often struggle to practice accountability because team members take too long to voice their concerns. Sometimes this delay is caused by a misguided attempt to avoid conflict by covering up the truth. However, in many cases, the team is simply slow in recognising that a significant problem exists. It pays for group project teams to adopt certain agile development practices that promote speedy recognition of delays and other concerns:- Assign small tasks. A task or a bundle of tasks is only`` small enough'' if the person assigned to it can complete the work before the next week. This rule of thumb supports weekly tracking: a task should be completed or reported as incomplete in the next accountability meeting. If it is not done, it suggests that either the task was too large or the team member failed to deliver. Irrespective of the underlying reason, both situations require discussion. Assuming a weekly 15- hour workload allocation for this module,"}

If it is not done, it suggests that either the task was too large or the team member failed to deliver. Irrespective of the underlying reason, both situations require discussion. Assuming a weekly 15- hour workload allocation for this module, tasks should generally take no more than 10 hours, with a deadline of 7 days or less.- Assign vertical tasks. A vertical task includes all the layers needed to deliver a small, functional improvement, including UI, control logic, helper functions, and data storage. Vertical tasks immediately add value to the software and are usually more independent of one another, reducing the likelihood of delays cascading across the team. In contrast, horizontal tasks, those focused solely on one aspect of the software( e. g., all UI screens), often depend on other layers being in place first. Horizontal task specification introduces additional risks that delays have knock on effects.- Discuss and agree what it means for a task to be complete. In teams where the members do not have a shared set of expectations of what constitutes a completed task, delivery of work can lead to disappointment. As a general rule, you should:- Require each developer to write their own automated tests immediately. In other words, each team member should write the test code for their own source code. They must do this before, or immediately after writing the source code. Tests protect source code against the introduction of bugs: if someone introduces to source code breaking changes, complete automated tests will pick these up forcing the author of problematic code to correct their work. Without tests, source code breaking changes can be introduced unchallenged. Procrastination and delegation of testing are both recipes for poor or late testing.- While attaining high code cleanliness and design standards require substantial code inspections and"}

Teams that do not agree common standards may end up with significant differences in the quality of work of different team members, which can breed resentment. To avoid this, agree a standard of code cleanliness that each team member can and should achieve in their own work. Adopting these practices early supports regular progress, early identification of issues, and a healthier team dynamic based on shared expectations and visible contributions."}

This often comes at the expense of code quality or testing.\n\n- Reduced team capacity: If some members disengage or do not engage at all, the remaining workload may become unsustainable. The scope needs to be reduced.\n\n- Technical debt: Features are delivered with incomplete testing or inspection, leaving a backlog of work that must be addressed.\n\n- Disruptive behaviours: A team member might disregard task boundaries, overwrite others' work, or over-communicate.

In the context of the student group project, the closing phase culminates with submission. However, this stage involves more than simply uploading a file to KEATS: it is a critical part of the project lifecycle that requires careful coordination, attention to detail, and reflection. Before submitting your work, the team must perform thorough quality control:- Review your submission: Have you included everything required for the examiners to assess the work? Conversely, have you excluded any unnecessary items( e. g., the full Git repository)?- Verify instructions: Do the installation and setup instructions work on a fresh machine that has not been configured for development?- Confirm deployment: Is the software deployed, seeded with relevant data, and accessible using the required user credentials? Preparing and completing the submission is a collective team responsibility. Therefore, it requires a coordinated team effort: one that requires adequate time to complete. Beware that ensuring everything works as intended at the point of submission can be surprisingly complex. Start submitting early! Do not leave submission until the final hours before the deadline. Servers are often under heavy load near submission deadlines and may respond slowly, or fail altogether. Starting early gives your team time to respond to unexpected problems without unnecessary stress. Once submission is complete, take time to reflect. Project experience help you develop critical professional skills, including effective communication, collaboration with others, planning, risk management, and decision- making.

While it is natural to feel frustrated if things did not go perfectly, more valuable insights often come from reflecting on your own actions: what you contributed, how you communicated, and how you adapted. The group projects provide multiple opportunities to learn from your experience. You will write peer assessments for your team mates. You will receive feedback from your peers in the form of the peer assessments they wrote. You will receive detailed feedback from markers once assessment is complete. You may also chose to have a constructive debrief with your teammates. Engage fully with these opportunities. They are designed not just to assess your performance but also to help you learn. Last but not least, feel free to celebrate the end of your project and your successes. Recognising what you have achieved together is not only satisfying. It is a great way to build friendships and connections with fellow students who may be your future colleagues or collaborators."}

All the decisions that must be made throughout a project's lifecycle rely first and foremost on good communication. Take scheduling project tasks, for example. This may seem like an optimisation problem. However, finding a good solution to the problem is rarely difficult unless the project is particularly large or severely constrained. Scheduling becomes difficult when different people have a different understanding of a task's expectations, when the people doing the actual work realise the task is much harder than the rest of the team appreciate, or when something goes wrong in the completion of a task but not everyone is aware of the problem or appreciates what it is. Resolving these issues requires good communication.\n\nThis section aims to identify the diverse means of communication you use in the group projects, what you need to communicate via each means, and why it is important."}

Whether it is to clarify a detail of a task, to ask or receive some help with a problem, or simply to vent one's frustrations or encourage a team mate, project teams benefit from open communication channels that can be used without too much formality. \n\nTo promote informal communication, you can use a number of approaches and tools. One approach is to work together in the same room (you can use the labs, but take care not to disturb others using the same space for work). This allows for the most effortless informal communication, but it does involve some organisation and travel. Another is to use a messaging and/or video conference service. There are messaging services that are designed for professionals, or for software engineers in particular, but any tool everyone in the team feels comfortable with is fine. When relying on messaging, beware that your working hours may not be the working hours of your team mates, and everyone is entitled to their personal time and space. When using a messaging service, teams should have a conversation about boundaries, such as out-of-hours messaging.\n\nInformal communication complements a range of more formal forms of communication. It cannot be a substitute for the latter. For example, you should not use your messaging tool or informal chats to make important decisions, or allocate work to someone who does not attend meetings."}

Important discussions and decisions about the direction of the project, including task allocation and holding the team accountable, should be made at a team meeting. This ensures that everyone in the team has a chance to consider and comment on the decision, there is a clear decision point( rather than an endless discussion in a messaging board), and everyone is informed of the decision. A team meeting is a particular type of gathering where the team informs itself about the state of the project and makes key decisions about its future direction. Other occasions where the team gets together, such as a brainstorming session, a collaborative coding session, or a presentation, will not be referred to as meetings here. To be effective, a team meeting needs to be purposeful. It requires everyone' s full participation and concentration. To achieve this, you will keep your meetings short and on point. Key aspects of the process and outcomes need to be documented in writing, so that there is a record of the team' s decisions. To achieve this, teams should follow this protocol:- Scheduling: To schedule meetings efficiently, schedule all meetings once at the start of the project by booking a regular time and place( i. e. same time and place each week) at the start of the project. Ad hoc scheduling of individual meetings makes organising meetings time consuming, and this gets only harder as a term progresses. Teams that do not schedule their meetings at the outset tend to have a hard time keeping the team engaged, and sometimes fail to organise any meetings.

Your meetings should have a clear start and end time. People can only focus for a limited period of time, and they also need to be able to meet other commitments. As a general rule, it should be possible to complete a team meeting in 30 minutes, but I recommend scheduling 1- hour slot per meeting to allow for inefficiencies.- Roles: Prior to the meeting, assign one team member to chair the meeting and a second team member to take minutes. The chairperson will be responsible for guiding the conversation, ensuring all attendees have a equitable chance to participate. The minute taker is responsible for preparing and distributing the meeting agenda, taking the meeting minutes, and making corrections as necessary.- Agenda: Every meeting should have a clear agenda, written up and shared with all members of the team well in advance of the meeting itself. This ensures that everyone knows what to expect at the meeting, and can prepare accordingly. For each agenda topic, consider carefully what outcome you are looking for( e. g. agreement, information, decisions on actions, etc.). Avoid open- ended discussion topics: these are best handled through preparation outside meetings( see below). Assign each item to a person or persons responsible for presenting them. Sometimes, this can be a single person presenting their findings of an information gathering exercise. Sometimes, every member of the team will be required to report something.

Consider, for example, deciding what technology stack to use to develop your software. That decision should consider a range of factors, including the team' s training requirements, available tools( e. g. for automated testing, test evaluation, and other build automation tasks), and ease of deployment. Before considering this decision at a meeting, the team should have collected all necessary information. Preparation could include all team members trying out the technology stack, and trialling build automation tools and deployment. Preparation tasks are typically assigned through an action log( see below).- Attendance: Attendance at team meetings is mandatory. Regular absences preclude a team member from engaging adequately with the team. As an incentive to attend, get into the habit of recording attendance accurately from the outset.- Meeting: During the meeting, the team should have a focussed discussion of all agenda items. It is important to stay on- topic: leave out small talk or anything unrelated to the agenda. While these other types of conversations are important, they prolong and detract from the meeting. The chairperson' s role is keep the meeting on track. Often, meetings do not go entire to plan, especially when an agenda item does not resolve itself through conversation.

The chairperson must also ensure everyone has a fair chance to participate and this may involve calling on dominant voices to listen to others and on quiet people for their views and concerns.- Minutes: The meeting minutes are the definite record of the outcome of the meeting. It typically includes all decisions that were made during meeting, ideally accompanied by the underlying rationale. Where a decision involves significant risk or controversy, alternative options and their rationale should be documented too. The minute taker is responsible for writing the minutes in a timely manner, ideally during and immediately after the meeting, sharing them with the rest of the team( you will be using Team Feedback for this), and acting on requests for corrections. The team members are responsible for reading the minutes and pointing out any errors.- Action log: Alongside the minutes, the minute taker should also maintain an action log of tasks arising from your meetings. Whenever an agenda item is not resolved into a decision or agreement, more preparation work will normally be required. These should be compiled into a`` To Do'' list for the team.

The bulk the work associated with your software engineering group project consists of software development/ engineering tasks. These tasks are distinct from the actions arising from meetings: they are substantial pieces of work that contribute directly to the project objective and may require careful scheduling and monitoring. A typical software development task involves source code development, test code development, and quality control. Delays in one task can impact the work of others.

In team based software development, version control tools provide the means to share code and information about that code. In this module, we will be using git and GitHub for version control. Version control tools provide an important means of communication. As you develop code, it is important that you share your work with the rest of team immediately by making commits and pushing them to the remote repository. This signals to team mates that you are working on a task. On the days that you work on the project' s code base, you should be making and pushing at least one commit per day( ideally more if you are doing anything substantial).- Commit messages: A commit message in a Git repository should clearly and concisely communicate the purpose and scope of the changes introduced in that commit. It serves as a historical record for other developers( and your future self), helping to explain what was changed and why. A well- written commit message typically begins with a short, imperative- style summary( e. g.,`` Fix broken image rendering on mobile'') no longer than 50 characters, followed optionally by a more detailed explanation in the body if needed. The message should focus on the intent of the change rather than the technical details of how it was implemented, as the code itself shows the`` how''. Good commit messages improve collaboration, make debugging and reviewing easier, and enable meaningful version history and change logs.- Issues: If you are using them, a Git issue should clearly describe a problem, feature request, or task in a way that is understandable to others who may work on it or review it later.

It should include a concise and descriptive title that summarises the issue, followed by a detailed explanation that provides necessary context. For bugs, this typically includes steps to reproduce the problem, expected vs. actual behaviour, relevant error messages or logs, and environment details. For feature requests or tasks, the issue should describe the motivation, desired outcome, and any constraints or dependencies. A well- written issue helps prioritise work, facilitates effective collaboration, and ensures that team members have a shared understanding of the problem or goal being addressed.- Pull requests: A Git pull request is a request to merge a development branch into the main branch. The request should clearly communicate the purpose, scope, and context of the proposed changes to facilitate efficient review and collaboration. The title should be concise but descriptive, summarising what the pull request does( e. g.,`` Add pagination to search results''). The request may reference the task or user story it implements. The description should explain why the changes are being made, referencing related issues or tickets when applicable, and outline what has been changed at a high level. If relevant, it should include changes that could be deemed out of scope of the original task, known limitations, or any points requiring special attention during review.

Teams must not perform hard resets, rebase, reflog+ reset, branch deletion, or similar operations on their repository. You can revert a commit as that operation preserves the commit history. The most critical operation in a shared repository is that of merging branches. When merging two branches in a Git repository, conflicts can occur if the same lines in a file were changed differently on both branches, requiring manual resolution. Additionally, unintended changes may be introduced if one branch is outdated or not properly tested, leading to broken functionality or regressions. If the merge is forced or not reviewed carefully, it may also overwrite or discard important work from one of the branches. Therefore, every team needs to agree on a carefully designed process-- one that includes appropriate checks and balances-- to merge development work from a branch with the rest of the code."}

The ratio of the amount of time software engineers spend reading code vs. writing code is said to exceed 10: 1 Martin: 2009. When working in a team, much of that code will be written by others. Thus, code is a form of communication in its own right. In a larger project, it is important to invest some of your time to write clean code that you and your teammates are able to make sense of throughout the development period. The importance of clean code extends to automated test suites. As these test suites prescribe how the code is expected to behave, developers can use these to understand the software' s specifications. Writing clean code in a group project requires a concerted effort from the whole team. It takes somewhat more effort to identify the cleanliness of an individual developer' s code compared to the functionality that that developer contributed. When time is limited, individual developers may be tempted to cut corner in an effort to meet deadlines and report good progress at meetings. To ensure high code cleanliness standards are maintained throughout the code, the team' s project management should include the following:- At the outset of the project, discuss and agree the code cleanliness standards expects to maintain throughout the development period. These standards should be specified in writing. The team must also discuss and agree a process to enforce the standards agreed by the team. Normally, such a process will include code reviews/ inspections at specific times.

Even when everyone in your team seems suitably engaged and active, many team members find themselves disappointed with the results their team is delivering. It can be temptingly convenient to blame this on your team mates. Once you have come to that conclusion, a typical response is either to push them to do more work, or resent them for not being good enough. A common cause of poor productivity, however, is waste. Therefore, productivity problems are best addressed by seeking and removing causes of waste. Typical causes of waste include Hooker+ Moir: 2022:- Software defects, such as bugs or source code that does not behave as required. Undetected software defects become increasingly intractable as a code base grows. This is especially problematic when software defects accidentally are introduced into a module as a developer is working on a different module or refactoring old code. Writing automated tests as soon as possible can help avoid many defects.- Relearning something you had already learned previously is duplication of work, and therefore wasteful. You may need to relearn something if you stop a task, and pick it up again at a later date. If you delay testing, you may need to relearn the source code that requires testing. If you delay refactoring, you may need to relearn the source code to be refactored.- Task switching is necessary when a developer is working on multiple tasks simultaneously. Some teams or individuals are tempted to take on more tasks, perhaps because they feel they are not producing enough work or because they struggle to finish work. However, adding more tasks to your`` To Do'' is not going to help you complete tasks any faster. On the contrary, every time you switch tasks, you need to switch"}

However, adding more tasks to your`` To Do'' is not going to help you complete tasks any faster. On the contrary, every time you switch tasks, you need to switch contexts and refocus. Some relearning may be needed. Managing your workload and priorities also becomes harder, and this can cause stress. Ultimately, you will become less productive. Avoid this by only taking on a new task after finishing another.- Incomplete or partially done work provides no value to end users. It is not generally awarded marks in the marking scheme. Effort expended on work that is not completed is wasted, and might have been put to better use on tasks that do add value. Avoid incomplete code by assigning small, vertical tasks.- Delays occur when a task needs to be put on hold. A common reason for a task is be blocked is late delivery of a dependency. Delays create waste due to relearning and task switching. They also increase the risk that the task will not be completed. Avoid delays by limiting dependencies between- Handoffs of tasks-- i. e. reallocating work to others in the team-- creates extra work. The extra work includes handoff communication, relearning, and task switching. It is best avoided by keeping tasks as independent of one another, and by keeping them small in scope.- Excessive features are software features that are not required, or beyond the capacity of the team to deliver. Extra features increase the amount and complexity of source code that needs to be built, maintained, refactored, and tested. But the effort needed to produce the source is not readily available to the team, so something( e. g. code quality or robustness of features) needs to be sacrificed."}

The relative importance of different characteristics varies from project to project. Nevertheless, there are certain characteristics, such as functional suitability, reliability, and maintainability, are important in all projects. Functional suitability is the degree to which a software system meets the stated or implied requirements. In other words, functional suitability refers to the extent to which a system meets the objectives it was built for. Reliability is the ability of a software system to perform its required functions consistently and without failure. Reliability includes, for example, a system's ability to fail gracefully under fault conditions (e.g. not losing data if an operation is interrupted). The ease with which a system and its component can be modified, corrected, or enhanced to improve performance or adapt to changing requirements. Functional suitability, reliability, and maintainability are ensured by writing clean code, employing sound design, and building comprehensive automated test suites. This chapter focusses on these means to attain software quality."}

Where the handbook mentions software design, what are you talking about?\n\nEffective software design is a cornerstone of maintainable, robust, and scalable systems. While surface-level concerns such as user interface aesthetics or code formatting practices may contribute to a positive development experience, the internal architecture of a software system determines its long-term viability. This section outlines foundational principles that guide the organisation of internal software structure, focusing on modular decomposition, separation of concerns, control of complexity, and the relationships between software components."}

A module may refer to a class, a file containing some functions, a package, etc. Each module encapsulates a specific subset of the system's functionality and interacts with other modules through well-defined interfaces. This decomposition facilitates independent development and testing, enhances reusability, and reduces the cognitive load on developers by allowing them to reason about individual modules without the need to comprehend the entire system at once.\n\nModular design further supports evolution and scalability. When new features are added or existing ones are modified, changes can often be localised to specific modules, thereby minimising the risk of unintended side effects. To be effective, however, modularity must be implemented with attention to both cohesion and coupling."}

A module is said to be highly cohesive when its constituent functions and data structures are directly related to one another and to the module's primary purpose. High cohesion fosters clarity and purpose within a module, making it easier to understand, test, and modify.\n\nClosely related to cohesion is the separation of concerns. This design principle advocates for dividing a system into distinct features or behaviours, each addressed by a separate module or layer. For example, data persistence, business logic, and network communication should each be handled by different parts of the system. Separation of concerns promotes clearer boundaries between responsibilities, reduces duplication, and simplifies the process of identifying and correcting defects.\n\nBoth cohesion and separation of concerns are undermined when a module takes on multiple, unrelated responsibilities or when the responsibilities of one module leak into another. Therefore, careful analysis and discipline are required during the design phase to ensure responsibilities are appropriately distributed."}

While some level of complexity is inherent to any non-trivial system, complexity that does not contribute directly to the system's requirements or maintainability constitutes a liability. Complex designs are harder to understand, more error-prone, and more costly to modify.\n\nTo manage complexity effectively, designers should favour simple and predictable patterns over intricate or speculative architectures. Generality should be introduced only when it is justified by demonstrated need, not in anticipation of hypothetical future scenarios. Adhering to the maxim ``Do not add functionality unless it is necessary'' helps prevent the accumulation of design debt and preserves the system's conceptual integrity. In other words, design for what you need now, not for what you currently think you will need in the future. Future plans often do not materialise or change, so design work intended to solve future problems risks complicating your system unnecessarily and wastes current time. Instead, keep the design simple but write the code in a way that makes it easy to change as your requirements evolve."}

In a well-designed system, modules should be loosely coupled. That is, changes to one module should have minimal impact on others. Ideally, modules are couples with as few other modules as possible. Loose coupling is achieved by minimising shared knowledge, using abstraction barriers (e.g., interfaces or abstract classes), and avoiding tight interconnections such as global variables or hard-coded dependencies.\n\nLoose coupling enhances a system's flexibility and adaptability. When modules interact through minimal, stable interfaces, it becomes possible to replace or refactor one module without extensive changes elsewhere. Conversely, high coupling leads to brittle systems where small changes ripple unpredictably, increasing maintenance overhead and regression risks.\n\nIt is important to note that coupling and cohesion are not independent: increasing cohesion within a module often leads to reduced coupling between modules, thereby reinforcing both qualities. Thus, a coherent approach to modularisation simultaneously advances multiple design goals."}

Manual testing typically involves exploratory activities performed by human testers, who interact with the software in search of unexpected behaviours, usability flaws, or integration issues. Manual testing can be valuable in uncovering edge cases that are difficult to anticipate programmatically. In practice, this looks as follows. As a developer, you should be developing a comprehensive test suite alongside the source code. It is also good practice to run the application and experience interacting with it yourself. In the process of doing so, you may encounter bugs( even if you produced a substantial test suite and all tests pass). When this happens, write an automated test that replicates the conditions causing the bug. Manual testing also plays a role in user acceptance testing and interface evaluation. Use it to assess whether the user interface is consistent, information is easy to find, the UI scales well to cope with large volumes of data, and user objectives can be achieved in an intuitive manner. It is also crucially important to thoroughly test a deployed system( especially prior to submitting it for marking!). Make sure that the use can log in with the provided user credentials and that all features work normally within a production environment( which is more restrictive than a testing environment). Also ensure that all static resources load normally. Automated testing FAQ( Testing): What is the role of automated testing? Automated testing consists of code that executes part of your source code and compares its actual behaviour with the expected behaviour. Automated testing allows tests to be defined once and executed repeatedly at negligible cost. The test code specifies how the source code is required to behave, thereby providing software specifications. It provides a reproducible safety net, making it possible to detect regressions from the required behaviour,"}

The test code specifies how the source code is required to behave, thereby providing software specifications. It provides a reproducible safety net, making it possible to detect regressions from the required behaviour, verify correctness under a wide range of conditions, and support continuous integration and deployment practices. Importantly, automated tests can be run frequently, on every commit if desired, ensuring that defects are detected as early as possible, when they are least expensive to fix. While certain aspects of software need to be tested manually or inspected, development teams should rely on automated tests as much as they can. Manual testing instead of automated testing? FAQ( Testing): Can we substitute automated testing by more extensive manual testing? Manual testing is inherently limited by its cost, subjectivity, and inconsistency. It cannot be repeated frequently or reliably across versions, and it does not scale to large or rapidly evolving systems. While manual testing can complement automated approaches, particularly during exploratory or usability evaluation, it must not substitute for automation. Software systems should be designed and implemented with the explicit goal of maximising test automation. Without it, long- term quality assurance is infeasible. Therefore, in the group projects, you are expected to produce software systems with comprehensive automated test suites."}

The presence of automated tests alone does not guarantee adequacy. In fact, as Dijkstra famously observed`` Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence!'' To minimise the risk of missing bugs, it is necessary to assess the quality and coverage of automated test suites, and address shortcomings. While no approach to evaluating test quality can guarantee an automated test suite is adequate, it can help identify and limit shortcomings. White- box testing and code coverage FAQ( Testing): How do code coverage tools help evaluate automated test suites? White- box testing techniques assess the structure of the source code itself. One of the most commonly used white- box tools is code coverage analysis, which measures the proportion of the code base executed by a test suite. Coverage metrics may include:- Statement coverage: whether each line of code has been executed.- Branch coverage: whether both the true and false paths of conditional statements are exercised.- Path coverage: whether all possible execution paths through a program are tested. While high coverage is desirable, it is not a substitute for meaningful tests. Superficial assertions may lead to high coverage without truly verifying correct behaviour. As such, coverage analysis should be used in conjunction with thoughtful test design, not as an end in itself. Black- box testing FAQ( Testing): Is high code coverage enough to have a good automated test suite? Code coverage tools can identify obvious problems with automated test suites. However, high code coverage does not guarantee that a test suite is good.

If your team relies solely on code coverage statistics to assess test quality, the developers in your team are incentivised to produce spurious tests that simply execute much of the source code, without making a meaningful attempt to find errors. Black- box testing techniques usefully complement code coverage reports. They evaluate the software from an external perspective without regard to internal implementation details. Black- box quality assessments often include:- Equivalence partitioning: dividing the input space into equivalence classes and testing representative values from each.- Boundary value analysis: testing inputs at and near the edges of valid input ranges.- Fuzz testing: supplying random or malformed inputs to uncover unexpected behavior or crashes. These approaches are particularly useful for identifying input- handling errors and integration issues that may not be visible through structural analysis alone."}

FAQ( Testing): Who should be writing automated tests? Developers should write automated tests for their own code. They should have the best understanding of the requirements to complete the task they were assigned, and they developed the solution. Outsourcing tests to other members of the team is both inefficient and risky. The tester needs to familiarise themselves with the task at hand, something the developer already did. The tester is likely have questions for the developer to help them understand the task or the solution. The tester may also fail to recognise certain flaws in a solution and not test for these. When? FAQ( Testing): When should we write automated tests? Tests should be written as soon possible, either before or concurrently with the source code. Test writing slows down the rate at which a developer can produce functionality. It can also be a little be boring. Do not procrastinate, however. The longer you wait to write tests, the worse your understanding of the task and solution approach will be. Therefore, postponing automated test writing is likely to lead to poorer tests. While your team is using source code not covered by automated tests, bugs introduced in that source code are much harder to discover. Consequently, if you postpone test writing, the team will benefit less from the tests. How? FAQ( Testing): What strategies can we adopt to ensure we produce good test suites? Achieving comprehensive test coverage is not an incidental byproduct of software development but a result of deliberate practices and cultural norms. Several strategies can help ensure that test suites are developed in tandem with, and at the same quality level as, production code:- Test- Driven Development( TDD): In TDD, developers write tests before implementing the corresponding functionality.

Contributions should not be accepted without accompanying tests, unless explicitly justified. The Semester 1 training materials explain how you can set this up for a Django project in GitHub.- Coverage thresholds: Enforcing minimum coverage levels using tools such as coverage. py, ensures that all changes meet a baseline level of test thoroughness. While this does not guarantee adequacy, it discourages neglect. Coverage statistics are also easy to verify, without meaningfully adding to the workload involved in your quality assurance process.- Reward thorough testing: Developers in your team must be motivated to write effective tests. If your team' s meetings or accountability sessions focus solely the functionality that team members have implemented, then you are motivating team members to produce source code at the expense of quality assurance. Do not consider a task complete unless it comes with a comprehensive test suite, and give people who produce excellent test suites recognition for their work."}

Forming groups for student group projects is a challenging task. The current system has emerged from many years of experience and experimentation aimed at finding a better way to achieve this. Over the years, we have made many attempts to group students based on academic attainment. These have included using Year 1 marks, in- term tests, and self- assessment. All these approaches have been severely flawed for two reasons. Firstly, while poor academic attainment tends to be a good predictor that student will struggle in a team, high academic attainment is a poor predictor for how well a student will fit in a team. As high academic attainment is much more common in Year 2 than poor academic attainment, academic attainment is a poor predictor for the team a student should be allocated to. Secondly, the most common challenge students face in group project is a mismatch in expected engagement. Specifically, if there are significant difference in expectations regarding the number of weeks students want to commit to the project, or the number of hours per week team members wish work, then some members of that team will struggle.

Beware that mark scheme is designed to enforce this expectation.- Recognise how the project management techniques you have learned the first half of Semester 1 apply to the project, and apply key skills including effective communication, agile planning/ scheduling, effort estimation, and risk management. It takes a considerable amount of time to acquire these skills. Normally, you need to start the learning process from the very start of Semester 1 in order to be ready to start the small group project immediately after reading week. You also need to organise your work on other modules in such a way that you can engage with the small group project team on a weekly basis. Of course, we all learn at a different pace. Therefore, you can participate in the small group project on different schedules."}

Software development projects are exposed to risks and challenges. To manage those risks and tackle those challenges, teams need time. With more time, teams have more space to recognise risks and challenges, discuss them, formulate a plan, and execute that plan. The small group project is designed to require six weeks of low intensity work. Teams are strongly recommended to use the full six weeks available to them, though working at a slow pace( up to 10 hours per week, or 25% of the working week), leaving time to complete other work concurrently. In practice, many students do not follow that recommendation for a variety of reasons. Some are simply not ready to participate in the small group project when the assignment is released because they lack the prerequisite skills and knowledge. Although I would recommend against this, some students choose to focus all of their effort on a single coursework at any one time. Members of the same team choosing to work to different schedules is a major cause of friction in teams. To address this, three different teamwork schedules are proposed. As part of the allocation process, you must choose one of the schedules and you will be allocated to a team of students who have selected the same schedule. Therefore, by choosing a schedule, you are making a commitment to the team that you join. Each schedule comes with a set of expectations that are enforced through the marking scheme. Think carefully about the implications and risks of selecting a particular schedule. Once you are allocated to a team, it will no longer be possible to make changes.

As the name suggests, the six week schedule spreads out the build of the software over a period of six weeks from the first week of teaching after Reading Week until the deadline. You are strongly recommended to choose this schedule, provided you are capable of meeting the expectations your teammates will have of you. The six week schedule has important advantages:- Because the project duration is spread out, the development pace can be slowed down. This gives teams ample time to design the product, control software quality( through code inspections and review), and correct problems as they arise.- When a new team starts collaborating, planning is extremely hard because it is nearly impossible to predict what team members are capable of producing in a given amount of time. Over time, you observe the work your team members produce and you have opportunities to inspect the code quality. This makes it easier to plan work. The six week schedule, you have the time to learn about the capabilities of your team mates and improve the quality of your plans.- Projects are inherently risky. Under a six week schedule, the team has time to recognise any risks that materialise and respond.- If some of your team' s initial arrangements do not work for you, the team has time to incorporate a mid- project review and change its ways of working.

The three/ two week schedule condenses the small group project into the shortest possible time period. The idea of this schedule is that students complete all other coursework due during Semester 1 before starting the group project. They then focus all their attention on the small group project. The three/ two week schedule is not recommended because it is inherently risky. It is offered because, every year, there are teams that adopt this schedule, irrespective of recommended practice. If you choose to work in this way, familiarise yourself with the risks. Note that if you chose to expose yourself to these risk, it is your responsibility to mitigate them and live with their impact! The risks of this shortened project schedule include the following:- Relatively minor setbacks can have a disproportionate impact on your participation in the project. For example, a bout of influenza or a bad cold can prevent you from participating in the project long enough that you will need to defer. As you would be completing the project in late Autumn, this is a very real possibility.- Quality control ensuring high standards of design, code cleanliness, and testing takes time. Normally, code is produced along with an automated test suite and then refined and improved.

Otherwise, all teams are marked in exactly the same way.

The most important are functionality, design, code, and testing. However, there are other criteria as well that assess specific aspects of your submission. The functionality criterion refer to the scope of the software: the range of features that were implemented, how well they focus on project objectives, how consistent their UI, how polished their implementation is, and the overall ambition and technical achievement of the team's work. Functionality is assessed in relation to the teams effective size. The design and code criterion refer to the quality of your source code and the overall design of your system.

The peer assessment exercise includes a set of multiple- choice questions for each of your peers. Scores are associated with each of the answers. A weighted sum of these scores is calculated to produce a score for each peer assessment by a reviewer about a reviewee. The weights favour engagement and contribution, but no question is weightless.

In the major group project, you will be working in teams of approximately 8($ 2$) people. There will be a selection of projects and teams can choose their own technology stack. As it is easier to do this in a team of people with shared project and technology preferences, students are strongly encouraged to form their own teams. Students who are unable to find a team can register to be allocated to one, in a similar manner as for the small group project. If you would like to work with some people, but are unable to create a group with 6-- 10 members, you can create a smaller project team to be extended through allocation. Students in teams that came together with a shared understanding of the kind of project they want to do, and how they wish to work tend to have the best experience. To find a major group project team, it helps to start networking as early as possible: from the start of the academic year. With the team formation deadline still far away, you have the time to get to know fellow students, what their interests, talents, goals, and values are. The lectures, small group tutorials, and the small group project all offer opportunities to meet and talk to fellow students.

The proposal must be approved. \\\\\n\n- Client-proposed project. These projects are proposed by a client who requires a software system to be developed to specific requirements.

You can only undertake a client project if you are assigned one following the bidding process.\\\\\n \n- Academic-proposed project. These are projects proposed by academics in the department.

Therefore, it is advisable to try deploying some software before committing to certain technologies.- How much effort is required to ensure the team becomes productive with a technology? Some teams choose a technology because one or two team member' s strongly advocate for it.

For example, it is obviously a bad idea to build an application with Apple' s XCode if a member of the team does not have a Mac. The requirements listed above tend to be easier to meet if teams build a web application. Modern technology stacks to build web applications tend to come with good testing tools. In deployment, teams have considerable control over the configuration of the( virtual) system the software runs on. Web applications are inherently cross- platform.

Often, a web application with a front- end developed for mobile browsers can be nearly indistinguishable from a native application. However, the web version will be easier to test and deploy.

Occasionally, a team chooses to build a computer game as their major group project. While this can be a very interesting project to do, such a project comes with considerable risks and challenging. It can be difficult to meet the testing requirements with certain modern game engines. Moreover, a minimum viable product( MVP) for a game can be quite substantial, leaving only limited scope to scale down the application.

Teams can use whichever project management approaches suit their team and project best. There is no requirement to follow the lean and agile approaches required in the small group project. Teams do not have to maintain a Kanban board. However, the project management approaches of the small group project have been designed to avoid or mitigate many of the risks involved in student group projects. If your team decides to deviate from this approach, consider the implications carefully. To ensure it is possible to maintain at least basic levels of accountability, teams must meet following expectations( irrespective of the project management approach used):- Teams must have at least one whole team meeting per week. Everyone must attend every whole team meeting. Team members must work on the tasks agreed with the team at team meetings, and only such tasks. Team members not attending meeting, expecting colleagues to tell them what to do or choosing their own work, will not normally be considered full members of the team. Team members must not decide what they work on without consultation of and agreement with the team. Without this, coordination of work between team members becomes impossible.- Teams must use git version control with either GitHub. com' s or King' s College London' s GitHub Enterprise service to version control their code base, their report document, and any prototype coding activities( including machine learning work). Use separate remote repositories on GitHub for each item your project requiresTeam Feedback encourages creating as few repositories as necessary. While you should not create more repositories than necessary, each distinct component of your project can have its own repository.. Register all shared repositories on Team Feedback. Without this, it is impossible to obtain a view of individual engagement with the project."}

While you should not create more repositories than necessary, each distinct component of your project can have its own repository.. Register all shared repositories on Team Feedback. Without this, it is impossible to obtain a view of individual engagement with the project.- Every member of the team must make demonstrable contributions to the project in every week of the project duration. These contributions should normally be visible in the team' s repository. Without weekly delivery of contributions, it is difficult for a team to predict what a member can and will contribute. This makes planning unnecessarily difficult. The major marking scheme is based on this expectation: if a peer assessment raises significant concerns, and there is no evidence of weekly contributions, then the scheme is applied.- Everyone must contribute significantly and meaningfully both to the report and the software. Work on the report and the software targets different learning outcomes, and it is important that all team members attain both. Moreover, the report must reflect the reflections of participants of software development project. To achieve this, the people writing the report must be the same people that completed the project.{- 30mmExpectation: Everyone must contribute substantially to both code and report. Do not create specialist roles where certain individuals contribute to only one and not the other. Contributions should be observable in the report and code repositories.}"}

This is normally known in advance of project selection. Ideally, the deployed system is available from within a web browser on a URL. Most web applications and mobile applications can be deployed that way. Generally speaking, a deployed system is one that is readily available for execution without the need to set up a comprehensive development environment. This is quite a vague statement, but it is impossible to be more precise as your options for deployment will vary considerably from project to project.- Team management data on Team Feedback: Team Feedback must have access to your team' s Git repositories.
